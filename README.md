# LED-Cube-VHDL
8x8x8 LED cube animations using vhdl and DE2 Altera Board

## The master file 
- Is located on the test_led folder and has the name TL.vhd, in here you can see all the called functions
- All the files what make the project work have .vhd extension

## The executable
Is located on test_led/output_files/TL.sof
- it is important to know that the DE2 has 72 GPIO pins and the way to connect the led cube to this inputs (Most important thing to use the executable) is not shown in here. Maybe in the future I will upload the pins assigments
